        <p>We can tailor-make a publicity appeal for a missing person,
          providing targeted local or national publicity which reaches out to
           the public for information and to the missing person to get in touch.</p>

        <p>Our publicity should reach two key ‘audiences’: the public,
          who may know something about the missing person or their whereabouts;
          and the missing person, who may see it and get in touch with someone as a result.</p>

        <p>Our publicity has a very wide reach. We have thousands of poster
          partners across Uganda, appeal slots in weekly and monthly publications,
          including the Daily Monitor and the SQOOP. Our partnership with Digital
          Out Of Home owners allows us to publish appeals on digital billboards in
          targeted geographical regions. We can also put appeals on our website, Facebook and Twitter.</p>
